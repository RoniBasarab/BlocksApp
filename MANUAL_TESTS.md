# Manual device tests (Task-4 §4.6, D9–D12)

D1–D8 are automated in `app/src/androidTest/java/com/roni/blocks/NotificationDeviceTest.kt`.
With a phone attached, run them with:

```bash
./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest
```

These four cannot be automated reliably (they depend on the launcher, the reboot flow, the keyguard
and the system DND state), so Roni runs them by hand.

## Setup for every test

- Install the debug build:

  ```bash
  ./gradlew installDebug      # com.roni.blocks.debug
  ```

- All steps below assume the **Sun/Tue/Wed** template, which is
  `cv 09:00–09:30`, `coding 09:30–11:30` (pomodoro 50/10), `free 11:30–14:00`,
  `coding 14:00–15:30` (pomodoro 50/10), `free 15:30–16:20`, `kidTime 16:20–22:30`.
  CV has no pomodoro, so **any time after 09:30 is the leak state**
  (`CV ran over`, action `Start Coding`).
- Start a day: clear the app's data so no day is running, launch the app, and pick
  `Sunday / Tuesday / Wednesday` on the picker.
- Move the clock with the debug time-travel receiver:

  ```bash
  adb shell am broadcast -n com.roni.blocks.debug/com.roni.blocks.debugtools.TimeTravelReceiver --es to 10:10
  adb shell am broadcast -n com.roni.blocks.debug/com.roni.blocks.debugtools.TimeTravelReceiver --ei plus 30
  adb shell am broadcast -n com.roni.blocks.debug/com.roni.blocks.debugtools.TimeTravelReceiver --ez reset true
  ```

  Moving the clock re-evaluates and reschedules; it is **not** an interruption, because nothing was
  actually missed.

## D9 — Relaunch from launcher after a swipe from recents

- [ ] Start the day so a block notification is posted.
- [ ] Swipe the app out of the recents list.
- [ ] Tap the notification.

**Expected:** a fresh start goes straight to **Home** — never the template picker, no crash, no blank
screen.

## D10 — Reboot mid-block

- [ ] Start the day, then travel to `10:10` (inside the 09:30–11:30 Coding block, focus 1).
- [ ] Reboot the phone.
- [ ] Unlock once the phone is back.

**Expected:** a **silent** notification for Coding (`Coding · Focus 1/2`) is posted after the reboot,
with a live countdown that ticks down. Nothing plays a sound on reboot, and the app never has to be
opened to get the notification.

## D11 — Lock screen

- [ ] Start the day, then travel to `10:10` (mid-Coding).
- [ ] Lock the phone.

**Expected:** the lock screen shows the Coding block and a **live countdown**, and the notification
wakes the screen.

## D12 — Do Not Disturb

- [ ] Turn Do Not Disturb **on**.
- [ ] Start the day, travel to `10:10`, then travel forward to `11:30` so the Coding block ends.

**Expected:** **no sound** when the block ends, but the notification still updates rather than going
stale — the title should become `Coding ran over` with the `Start Free` action.

## Known conflict that will affect D6 (automated, listed here for context)

`NotificationRenderer` sets `FLAG_ONGOING_EVENT`, which stock Android treats as non-dismissible.
`Task-4.md:88` mandates that flag while `Task-4.md:647` asks for a swipe-to-dismiss. If
`d6_swipeAway_staysGoneUntilTheNextTransition` fails on a real phone, that contradiction is the
cause, not the dismissal logic.
